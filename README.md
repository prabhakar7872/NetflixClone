# NetflixClone
1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Overview of the Project
The Netflix Clone is a responsive, interactive front-end project inspired by the original Netflix streaming platform. The clone replicates key features of the Netflix homepage including a hero banner, trending content, modals for login/signup, and a FAQ section, using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. The application uses dummy data and local video files to simulate a real OTT experience. While the current implementation is front-end only, the structure allows backend integration in the future.

1.2 Purpose of the Project
    • To apply and demonstrate front-end web development skills.
    • To understand layout design using CSS Grid/Flexbox.
    • To practice user interaction handling with JavaScript.
    • To simulate a media-rich application experience.
    • To lay the groundwork for full-stack web application development.
